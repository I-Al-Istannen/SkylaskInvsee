# Color codes are supported using the ampersand ('&') as color char.
# If you want to write an apostrophe (') in the message, you need to use two of them ('')
# You can specify a special format for some things like numbers, dates, percentages and other things.
#     You can find all of them here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html
# You can refer to other keys by using this notation: [[path.to.other.key]]
# This means, that "&cPrefix: [[prefix]]" will always display the prefix set in the language file. This allows for some neat contraptions such
# as embedding the usage of a command. Look at "command.invsee.target.is.player" for example.

# Bug reports or feature requests are welcome, I can't make any promises though
